# Test Gap Analysis

## Overview

After running the tests, we've identified several categories of failures that need to be addressed:

## Categories of Failures

### 1. Deno Import Issues
Many tests are using Deno-style imports which are not compatible with the Node.js environment:

```typescript
import { assertEquals, assertExists, assertThrows } from 'https://deno.land/std@0.208.0/assert/mod.ts';
import { describe, it, beforeEach, afterEach } from 'https://deno.land/std@0.208.0/testing/bdd.ts';
```

Examples:
- tests/integration/workflow-yaml-json.test.ts
- tests/unit/memory/memory-backends.test.ts
- tests/unit/coordination/coordination-system.test.ts
- tests/e2e/full-system-integration.test.ts
- tests/performance/load-testing.test.ts

### 2. ES Module/CommonJS Compatibility Issues
Similar to what we fixed for the core tests, there are import compatibility issues between ESM and CommonJS:

Example:
```typescript
SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module
```

Files affected:
- src/migration/tests/migration-system.test.ts (via inquirer import)

### 3. Missing Test Files or Implementation
Some tests are failing due to missing files or implementations:

```
No valid source directories found
```

Files affected:
- src/swarm/__tests__/integration.test.ts

### 4. Test Expectation Failures
Some tests are failing because the actual implementation doesn't match the expected behavior:

```
expect(received).toBe(expected) // Object.is equality
Expected: true
Received: false
```

Files affected:
- src/swarm/__tests__/integration.test.ts
- tests/integration/start-command-integration.test.ts

### 5. CLI Command Failures
Some tests are failing due to CLI command issues:

```
Command failed: node /Users/sethford/Downloads/Projects/claude-code-flow/cli.js start --help
```

Files affected:
- tests/integration/start-command-integration.test.ts

## Plan of Action

### Phase 1: Fix Import Issues
1. Create a Jest setup file to mock Deno imports or provide Node.js equivalents
2. Replace Deno URL imports with local dependencies

### Phase 2: Address ES Module Compatibility
1. Extend our solution from core tests to handle other modules
2. Update the Jest configuration to properly transform dependencies

### Phase 3: Fix Implementation Gaps
1. Fix missing source directories in swarm tests
2. Update implementation to match test expectations

### Phase 4: Fix CLI Command Tests
1. Update the CLI command tests to use the correct paths and expectations
2. Ensure CLI commands are working as expected

### Phase 5: Verify and Document
1. Run tests incrementally to verify fixes
2. Document all changes and approach
