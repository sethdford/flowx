# Test Fixes Documentation

## Issue

The core tests (`config.test.ts`, `event-bus.test.ts`, and `logger.test.ts`) were failing due to import problems after the recent refactoring. The main issues were:

1. The test files were importing from relative paths (`./config.js`) but the files didn't exist
2. The project uses ES modules, but Jest needed configuration to properly handle the modules

## Solution

We implemented a CommonJS-based bridge approach to fix the tests:

1. Created `.cjs` bridge files that:
   - Import the TypeScript modules from the source code using `require()`
   - Export them using CommonJS syntax (`module.exports`)

2. Updated the test files to import from these `.cjs` files instead

3. Modified the Jest configuration to properly handle the `.cjs` extensions and module mapping

## Files Modified

- Created bridge files:
  - `tests/unit/core/config.cjs`
  - `tests/unit/core/event-bus.cjs`
  - `tests/unit/core/logger.cjs`
  - `tests/unit/utils/types.cjs`

- Updated test import paths in:
  - `tests/unit/core/config.test.ts`
  - `tests/unit/core/event-bus.test.ts`
  - `tests/unit/core/logger.test.ts`

- Updated Jest configuration in:
  - `jest.config.js`
    - Added support for `.cjs` extension in `moduleNameMapper`
    - Updated `transform` regex to handle both `.ts` and `.cjs` files

## Considerations

1. We initially tried using `.mjs` files, but found that Jest requires additional configuration for ES modules
2. The CommonJS approach with `.cjs` files provided the simplest solution with minimal changes
3. All tests are now passing successfully

## Next Steps

1. Consider adding these patterns to any future tests that need to import from source files
2. Investigate upgrading to a more modern Jest configuration if the project moves entirely to ES modules
3. Standardize the approach across all tests for consistency

## Test Command

To run the tests:

```bash
npm test -- --no-cache tests/unit/core/config.test.ts tests/unit/core/event-bus.test.ts tests/unit/core/logger.test.ts
```
