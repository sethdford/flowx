## Improvement Strategies

### 1. Expand Core Component Coverage

#### Logger Enhancement
Add tests for:
- File operations with mocked file system
- Log rotation functionality
- Configuration updates
- Error handling scenarios

#### ConfigManager Enhancement
Add tests for:
- Validation rules
- Format detection and parsing
- File operations with mocked file system
- Environment variable loading
- Encryption/decryption functions

### 2. Test Critical Subsystems

The following high-priority subsystems should be tested next:

1. **Event Bus**
   - Event publication and subscription
   - Error handling
   - Event filtering

2. **Orchestrator**
   - Task scheduling
   - Concurrency control
   - Error handling

3. **MCP Integration**
   - Communication protocol
   - Tool registration and execution
   - Session management

4. **CLI Commands**
   - Command parsing
   - Execution flow
   - Error handling

### 3. Testing Infrastructure Improvements

To facilitate better testing:

1. **Mocking Framework**
   - Set up consistent mocking for file system operations
   - Create mock implementations for external dependencies

2. **Test Fixtures**
   - Create shared test fixtures for common test scenarios
   - Implement setup/teardown helpers

3. **CI Integration**
   - Configure coverage thresholds in CI
   - Automate test reporting

## Code Coverage Goals

### Short-term Goals (Next 2 Weeks)
- Core modules (logger, config, event-bus): 75%+ coverage
- Critical subsystems: 50%+ coverage
- Overall project: 15%+ coverage

### Medium-term Goals (Next Month)
- Core modules: 90%+ coverage
- Critical subsystems: 70%+ coverage
- Overall project: 30%+ coverage

### Long-term Goals
- Core modules: 95%+ coverage
- Critical subsystems: 80%+ coverage
- Overall project: 70%+ coverage

## Test Implementation Approach

### Unit Testing Strategy
1. Focus on pure functions and isolated components first
2. Use dependency injection to make components testable
3. Test edge cases and error handling paths

### Integration Testing Strategy
1. Create integration tests for subsystem interactions
2. Use realistic but controlled test data
3. Test error propagation between components

### System Testing Strategy
1. Create end-to-end workflows that test multiple subsystems
2. Focus on common user scenarios
3. Validate overall system behavior

## Conclusion

The current test coverage is very low, but we have established a working test framework and started testing core components. By focusing on critical subsystems and improving test infrastructure, we can systematically increase coverage and ensure the reliability of the Claude-Flow system.
