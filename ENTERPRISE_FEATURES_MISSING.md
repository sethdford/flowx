## üöÄ RECOMMENDATION

To achieve feature parity with the original claude-flow v2.0.0 alpha, we need to:

1. **Focus on Core Infrastructure** - Neural networks, hooks, memory system
2. **Implement Real Functionality** - Replace placeholders with working implementations
3. **Complete Tool Ecosystem** - Build the remaining 42 MCP tools
4. **Add Enterprise Features** - GitHub integration, visual UI, performance optimization

The current implementation is approximately **40-50%** complete compared to the original claude-flow v2.0.0 alpha specifications. Most critical missing pieces are the neural processing, advanced hooks, and enterprise integrations.
