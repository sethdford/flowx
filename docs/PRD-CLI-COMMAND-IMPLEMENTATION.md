# Claude Flow CLI Command Implementation - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

Claude Flow currently presents a comprehensive CLI interface with 60+ commands in its help system, but only 18 commands (30%) are fully implemented. This PRD outlines the systematic implementation of all 40+ missing commands to achieve 100% CLI functionality with real backend integration.

## Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ Implemented Commands (18/60+)
- `agent` - Agent management with real backend integration
- `batch` - Batch operations (mostly implemented)
- `benchmark` - Performance benchmarking
- `config` - Configuration management (mostly complete)
- `init` - System initialization
- `logs` - Log management
- `memory` - Memory bank operations with real persistence
- `migration` - Database migrations (structure exists)
- `monitor` - Real-time monitoring
- `restart` - System restart
- `sparc` - SPARC methodology workflows
- `start` - System startup with real orchestration
- `status` - Comprehensive system status

- `swarm` - Swarm management with real coordination
- `task` - Task execution with real agents
- `terminal` - Terminal management
- `ui` - Web console interface
- `workflow` - Workflow orchestration with TaskEngine

### ‚ùå Missing Commands (40+ commands)
All these commands from the help output are completely missing:
- `agents`, `alerts`, `analyze`, `architect`, `backup`, `cancel`, `clear`, `code`, `compare`
- `connections`, `create`, `daemon`, `debug`, `docs`, `down`, `exec`, `export`, `file`
- `get`, `health`, `history`, `import`, `kill`, `list`, `load`, `maintenance`, `open`
- `profile`, `query`, `remove`, `report`, `reset`, `restore`, `result`, `review`, `rotate`
- `run`, `scale`, `security`, `seed`, `services`, `set`, `show`, `spawn`, `stats`, `store`
- `stream`, `stress`, `swarms`, `system`, `tasks`, `tdd`, `template`, `templates`
- `unset`, `up`, `validate`

### üîß Mock/Incomplete Implementations
Several implemented commands contain mock implementations that need real backend integration:
- `stop-command.ts`: Mock agent/swarm management
- `restart-command.ts`: Mock service health checks
- `migration-command.ts`: Mock database operations
