# Claude-Flow to FlowX Migration Guide

This guide helps users migrate from Claude-Flow to FlowX.

## What's Changed

Claude-Flow has been rebranded as FlowX. This migration includes:

- Renamed CLI command from `claude-flow` to `flowx`
- Updated configuration paths from `.claude-flow/` to `.flowx/`
- Fixed several bugs and improved stability
- Enhanced test coverage for key components
- Improved error handling and dependency management

## Migration Steps

### 1. Update Executable References

If you've been using `claude-flow` in scripts or automation:

```bash
# Before
claude-flow command [options]

# After
flowx command [options]
```

For backward compatibility, `claude-flow` will continue to work during the transition period.

### 2. Configuration Files

Configuration has moved from `.claude-flow/` to `.flowx/`:

```bash
# Move your configuration files
mkdir -p .flowx
cp -r .claude-flow/* .flowx/
```

### 3. Environment Variables

Update any environment variables:

```bash
# Before
CLAUDE_FLOW_ENV=development

# After
FLOWX_ENV=development
```

### 4. API References

If you're using the API directly:

```typescript
// Before
import { ClaudeFlowError } from './utils/errors.ts';
import { createClaudeFlowTools } from './mcp/claude-flow-tools.ts';

// After
import { FlowXError } from './utils/errors.ts';
import { createFlowXTools } from './mcp/flowx-tools.ts';
```

### 5. Memory Files

Memory storage has been moved:

```bash
# Update memory database path reference
mv .claude-flow/memory.db .flowx/memory.db
```

## Breaking Changes

- Error class names have changed (e.g., `ClaudeFlowError` â†’ `FlowXError`)
- Some internal APIs have been modified for better type safety
- Configuration paths now use `.flowx/` instead of `.claude-flow/`

## Bug Fixes

This migration includes important fixes for:

- Circular dependency detection and handling
- Circuit breaker behavior in transient network conditions
- Conflict resolution for resource management
- Enhanced Jest compatibility for testing
- Improved error reporting with more context
