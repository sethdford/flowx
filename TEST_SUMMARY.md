# Test Summary for Claude-Flow

## Overview
The test suite for Claude-Flow has been updated and verified. We fixed various issues with imports in test files and created new tests for core components.

## Working Tests
We have confirmed that the following test files are now working:

- `src/simple.test.ts` - Basic validation of test infrastructure
- `src/core/config.test.ts` - Tests for ConfigManager functionality
- `src/core/logger.test.ts` - Tests for Logger functionality

## Fixed Issues

### Import Issues
- Fixed incorrect import extensions (`.ts` â†’ `.js`) in multiple files
- Corrected import paths in test files
- Updated Jest configuration to properly resolve imports

### Test Implementation
- Created simplified tests to ensure the testing infrastructure works
- Created tests for core components (ConfigManager, Logger)
- Ensured tests are compatible with both Node.js ESM and Jest

## Remaining Challenges
There are still issues with some of the existing tests:

1. Many test files use imports from packages that are not compatible with Jest's module system
2. Some tests have dependencies on modules that need to be mocked properly
3. Tests that use `import.meta.url` and other ESM-specific features need special handling

## Next Steps for Complete Test Coverage

1. Create more unit tests for core components:
   - Event bus
   - Orchestrator
   - Terminal integration

2. Add integration tests for:
   - MCP integration
   - Command registry
   - Swarm coordination system

3. Set up proper test fixtures and mocks for external dependencies

4. Configure code coverage reporting to identify areas with insufficient test coverage

## Running Tests

To run the working tests:

```bash
npm run test -- src/simple.test.ts src/core/logger.test.ts src/core/config.test.ts
```

This will execute all the currently working tests and show their results.
