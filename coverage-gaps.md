## Action Plan

### 1. Improve Coverage for These Files

- [ ] src/swarm/sparc-executor.js (57.1% average, branches need most work)
- [ ] src/task/commands.js (61.7% average, branches need most work)
- [ ] src/task/coordination.js (64.7% average, branches need most work)
- [ ] src/memory/indexer.js (65.3% average, branches need most work)
- [ ] src/task/engine.js (67.4% average, branches need most work)

### 2. Testing Strategy for Each Component

#### Swarm Components
For swarm components (sparc-executor.js and coordinator.js):
- Create unit tests for individual methods
- Mock dependencies to test error handling paths
- Create integration tests for swarm workflow scenarios
- Test different agent configurations and modes

#### Task Components
For task components (commands.js, coordination.js, engine.js):
- Test task creation and management
- Test task lifecycle (create, start, update, complete)
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Create integration tests for task coordination

#### Memory Components
For memory components (indexer.js, manager.js, sqlite.js):
- Create more comprehensive property-based tests
- Test edge cases like large data sets
- Test concurrent operations
- Test error handling paths

#### Core Components
For logger.js:
- Test different log levels
- Test formatting options
- Test destination configurations
- Test error handling

### 3. Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1 - Focus on Critical Components**
   - Create additional tests for sparc-executor.js
   - Create additional tests for task/commands.js
   - Create additional tests for memory/indexer.js

2. **Phase 2 - Improve Component Integration**
   - Create integration tests for swarm and task coordination
   - Test task engine with various workflow scenarios
   - Test memory backend with stress conditions

3. **Phase 3 - Edge Case Coverage**
   - Add tests for error conditions
   - Add tests for boundary conditions
   - Test performance under load

4. **Phase 4 - Verify Coverage**
   - Run coverage reports
   - Verify coverage thresholds are met
   - Document test strategies for future maintenance
